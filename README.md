# Web Development Project 1 - *Miami Dolphins Schedule*

Submitted by: **Chase Moffat**

  My project is a dashboard that displays the first 10 oponents the Miami Dolphins played this season. I have main compoents in my project. App.jsx,ScheduleBoard.jsx, and Card.jsx. In my App component there is an array of dictionaries containing the information for the games. In the return statement on the App component there is a div containg the ScheduleBoard component, this is where the games array is passed as a prop. In the schedule board component there is a div where a map fucntion then passes each dictionary in the games array as a prop to the Card component. The games data is then displayed in a game card.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total
